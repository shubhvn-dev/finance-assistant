I need this repo to be setup for my finance AI project
I want a separate backend and frontend folder within the root directory
the backend will be FastAPI and python based, and the frontend will be Next or React TypeScript based hence the separation
Make the required changes to the file system to get this done as per project.md ignore the current structure as we are modifying it based on the above point
