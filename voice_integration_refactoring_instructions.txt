Currently the frontend code has been written to integrate an elevenlabs agent that uses agent id corresponding to a publiushed agent
The frontend has the Voice interface already setup as described above in the VoiceCallUI.tsx file
I need you to change the integration as follows:
- I am switching from using the elevenlabs agent to the eleven labs text to speech API, or whatever API is necessary to replicate this functionality
For any reference related to this you can refer this link for the documentation: "https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech/v-1-text-to-speech-voice-id-stream-input"
Essentially this will create a websocket setup
Make any changes such as an endpoint to hanlde all of this if required in the backend/ directory
There should be a button to start and end the call as it already displays in the current UI. We are just switching the agent to the websocket API integration
Ask any clarifying questions if necessary
